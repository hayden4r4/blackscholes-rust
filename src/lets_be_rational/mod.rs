/// Calculates the price of a European option using the Black model.
///
/// This function computes the theoretical price of a European call or put option based on the Black model, which is an extension of the Black-Scholes model for futures contracts. The model assumes that the price of the underlying asset follows a geometric Brownian motion and that markets are frictionless.
///
/// # Arguments
/// * `forward_price` - The forward price of the underlying asset.
/// * `strike_price` - The strike price of the option.
/// * `sigma` - The volatility of the underlying asset's returns.
/// * `time_to_maturity` - The time to maturity of the option, in years.
/// * `option_type` - The type of the option (call or put), represented by `OptionType`.
///
/// # Returns
/// The theoretical price of the option as a `f64`.
///
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// use option_valuators::OptionType;
/// use option_valuators::lets_be_rational::black;
///
/// let forward_price = 100.0;
/// let strike_price = 95.0;
/// let sigma = 0.2;
/// let time_to_maturity = 1.0;
/// let option_type = OptionType::Call; // For a call option
///
/// let price = black(forward_price, strike_price, sigma, time_to_maturity, option_type);
/// println!("The price of the option is: {}", price);
/// ```
///
/// # Note
/// The function uses the natural logarithm of the forward price over the strike price,
/// multiplies it by the square root of time to maturity, and applies the option type
/// to determine the final price. It's suitable for European options *only*.
